  <PRF_DeepQuarry_mkIII_HelpText>This quarry will extract random rare ores from ground from steel to gold, please note if any mod is added that adds ores those will be mined here too including stone type, that will need a patch to fix</PRF_DeepQuarry_mkIII_HelpText>
  <PRF_DeepQuarry_HelpText>The deep quarry is used for extraction of random mineral resources from underground, and produces a resource on average once every 6 hours. It functions like a colonist miner would - it randomly selects a rock or compacted resource (Granite, compacted steel) according to commonality and returns its mined products. Hence, rock chunks are the most common products of deep quarries, followed by the various commonalities of other resources.</PRF_DeepQuarry_HelpText>

  <PaperclipFactory_HelpText>The paperclip factory doesn't just take in steel - it can make paperclips from any item by manipulating its subatomic structure. The number of paperclips produced is equivalent to 1/4 of the combined mass of the ingredients.</PaperclipFactory_HelpText>
  <PaperclipFactory_OrdoText><![CDATA[<b>Ordo Historia Standardization Archive - OHS 15616 - A paperclip used as feedstock for a standard atomic 3d printing device(OHS 6011)</b>
Section 1.1 - Physical properties
- A single paperclip must weigh 1.0 ± 1*10^-8 grams.
- It can be made out of any form of matter, including exotic matter(OHS 11279) such as Dalekanium, Unobtainium or Vibranium; however, the end product has to exhibit the properties of a metal such that it is pliable, ductile and malleable.
- Paperclips must have a positive real mass.
- For instructions about how to manufacture a paperclip, see the Lantz-Foddy method for producing paperclips from matter(OHS 58281)

  <CultivatorTools_b18Cultivator_HelpText>The cultivator operates automatically if it is given power. It will sow and harvest crops in growing zones and output them into a nearby cell. If you also have the mod SeedsPlease installed, the cultivator requires seeds to be placed next to it for sowing to work.</CultivatorTools_b18Cultivator_HelpText>

  <CultivatorTools_Sprinkler_HelpText>The sprinkler randomly boosts the growth of crops and plants by 1 hour each round. You can see which cell it is currently working at by selecting it.</CultivatorTools_Sprinkler_HelpText>
  <FuelingMachine_HelpText>The fueling machine is quite easy to use. Point the robotic arm (yellow cell) at the building you want to fuel, place fuel next to it(white cells) and give it power.</FuelingMachine_HelpText>
  <PRFPaperclipPowerGenerator_HelpText>The paperclip power generator is just like a normal power generator, except it runs off paperclips and has 2 extra features:\n1. You can adjust the fuel consumption rate to ramp up/down the power production.\n2. After unlocking "Paperclip power generator: self-improvement" in research, power production efficiency can slowly ramp up, as long as the building has fuel and is powered at all times.</PRFPaperclipPowerGenerator_HelpText>
  <AtomicReconstructor_HelpText>The atomic reconstructor turns paperclips into items. Simply fuel it up, add power, set the item you want to produce and wait. You can also make it work faster by adjusting the slider. Note that the speed is directly proportional to the square of the paperclip cost, for example if you set the speed to 2x, it will use 4x more paperclips.\n\nGenerally, items that are more expensive take longer to make, and items that are heavier cost more paperclips.\n\nNote: The atomic reconstructor cannot make any items that have to be made from a material (for example, steel longsword)</AtomicReconstructor_HelpText>
  <PRFPaperclipDuplicator_HelpText>Think of the paperclip duplicator as a bank: it stores paperclips and gives you a set interest on those paperclips. The Duplicator tab provides an interface for you to deposit/withdraw paperclips. Note that you need to provide a cargo platform as an item source for depositing/withdrawing paperclips.\n\nThe formula that is used for calculating the current paperclip amount is:\nCurrentBalance = 1.05^(DaysPassed) * InitialBalance</PRFPaperclipDuplicator_HelpText>
  <PRFStorageUnitIOPort_HelpText>To configure the storage unit I/O port, set the mode (input or output), and the unit you want to connect to. If you choose output, remember to also select the item that you want to pull.\nYou can use right click on storage tab to directly output that item/stack eq. a weapon, into selected I/O port.</PRFStorageUnitIOPort_HelpText>
  <PRFStorageUnitIOPortFridge_HelpText>This works like I/O port \n IT have a strange behavior with RimFridge comp i need to look at, if not working try set cargo platform again and swap in/out and make sure settings are ok, it should work with some fiddeling. (looking for a fix)</PRFStorageUnitIOPortFridge_HelpText>
  <SAL_SmartHopper_HelpText>The Vacuum hopper pulls in nearby items from ground or stockpile cells onto itself and hold until a assembler can use it.\n\n If you want to use it on a assembler, remember to enable the assembler's "toggle allow forbidden" option to allow assembler to pull from hopper.</SAL_SmartHopper_HelpText>

  <StockpileCrateReinforced_HelpText>To output to crates and cargo platforms with the "Industrial Rollers" mod, remember to use a roller pusher at the end.</StockpileCrateReinforced_HelpText>
  <PRFCargoPlatform_HelpText>The Industrial Storage unit (DSU) functions like any other storage building, but all items put inside are moved to the middle cell, allowing for virtually infinite storage capacity. There’s a limit set in mod setting, if set too high it might lag.\n\nTo prevent considerable lag in heavily used cargo platforms, the item readout in the "Items" tab only displays the first 500 items. You can, however, search for the item you want using the search bar.\n\nNOTE: To output to crates and cargo platforms with the "Industrial Rollers" mod, remember to use a roller pusher at the end.\nTo set direct DSU output right-click the desired output item in the DSU item list to have it move to the DSU output cell. \nYou can also right click and select a pawn and force wear to equip items from storage\n\n Pawn acces button forbid pawn to go directly into DSU and only use I/O</PRFCargoPlatform_HelpText>
